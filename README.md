# SheAid 
SheAid aims to rebuild public trust in charity.
By combining Web3 verifiability with the humanity of social organizations, SheAid creates a transparent, trustless donation chain where every transaction is traceable, procurement is fair, and the privacy of female and minor recipients is protected.
